# hunt-the-wumpus

## Description
A simple game using Java Swing. Navigate a randomly generated labyrinth and attempt to slay the Wumpus before it eats you.

## Installing
Download the repository. Execute `javac HuntTheWumpus.java` to compile and `java HuntTheWumpus` to run.

## Gameplay
Use WASD to move around in the labyrinth. Text at the bottom of the screen will inform you if you smell the wumpus (the wumpus is two squares away). If you enter the wumpus's square, you lose the game. If you think you have located the wumpus, press spacebar to draw your arrows and then choose a direction to shoot with WASD. If you miss, the wumpus will find you and eat you. If you hit the wumpus, you win the game!
